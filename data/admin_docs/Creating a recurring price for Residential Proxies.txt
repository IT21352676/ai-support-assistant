    - Any product can have two types of prices:
        - One-time - Customer is billed once
        - Recurring - Customer is billed on a recurring basis (eg: Monthly)
    - 
    - You can add recurring prices to any existing product.
    - Each product can have both one-time and recurring prices at the same time.
    - We have introduced our residential proxies with a convenient recurring pricing model.
    - Only in each successive billing cycle, the customer will be delivered the originally delivered product on their first checkout. They
    - will not
    - be delivered a new list each time their subscription updates.
    - If you want to update their delivered product, you can do so by following the below guide:
      - https://docs.torchlabs.xyz/data-center-and-accounts/edit-and-view-delivered-a-products
    - 
  - Before you add a recurring price, you also need to make sure you have the customer billing portal set up as well.
  - 
      - To implement recurring prices in the residential proxies, we can add the same to the existing products. Therefore, go to an existing product you have created within Stripe.
