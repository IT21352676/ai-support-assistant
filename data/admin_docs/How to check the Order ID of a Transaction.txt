  - Overview
  - We have introduced a new feature that adds an "Order ID" to transactions on the Customer Dashboard for ISP orders. This enhancement allows users to differentiate between multiple orders, making tracking and managing them easier.
  - How to check the Transaction ID
      - First, log in to the User Dashboard. Then, click on the "
      - ISPs
      - " tab. Once logged in, navigate to the "ISPs" tab, which may have a different name depending on your service provider. In such cases, look for a tab related to ISP Proxies.
    - 
      - In the top-left corner of the window, youâ€™ll find a section labelled "
      - Recent Orders
      - ". This area provides a summary of your recent transactions. Within this section, there is a column titled "
      - ID
      - ," where you can view the
      - Transaction IDs
      - for each order. These IDs are unique to each transaction, allowing you to easily track and manage your ISP orders.
    - 
      - To copy a Transaction ID, simply click on it. Once copied, the ID will change to green, indicating that it has been successfully copied.
