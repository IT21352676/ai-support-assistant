    - Any product can have two types of prices:
        - One-time - Customer is billed once
        - Recurring - Customer is billed on a recurring basis (eg: Monthly)
    - 
    - You can add recurring prices to any existing product.
    - Each product can have both one-time and recurring prices at the same time.
    - Recurring products are only available for Datacenter and Accounts products only at the moment. Residential products are coming soon.
    - Only in each successive billing cycle, the customer will be delivered the originally delivered product on their first checkout. They
    - will not
    - be delivered a new list each time their subscription updates.
    - If you want to update their delivered product, you can do so by following the below guide:
