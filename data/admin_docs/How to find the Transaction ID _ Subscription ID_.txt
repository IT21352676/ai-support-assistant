  - There are two subsections under the "Transactions" tab on the Admin dashboard: "Payments" and "Subscriptions." Each type of transaction has a unique transaction ID that can be found in the "Payments" tab, while each subscription has a unique subscription ID. These IDs will assist you in identifying specific transactions. Furthermore, they will be invaluable when communicating any errors or issues related to transactions with Torch Labs.
