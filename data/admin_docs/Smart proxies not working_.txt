  - There are a few reasons that smart proxies might not work
      - The customer might not have data
      - Their order has failed - they haven't received their data
      - They may be out of data - not having enough data
      - They may be testing on google. Smart proxy does not allow testing on Google therefore please ask the customers to test the proxies on a website like Footlocker.
